# Question 
## Write a program to implement Heap Sort

```
Input data: 4, 10, 3, 5, 1
         4(0)
        /   \
     10(1)   3(2)
    /   \
 5(3)    1(4)

The numbers in bracket represent the indices in the array 
representation of data.

Applying heapify procedure to index 1:
         4(0)
        /   \
    10(1)    3(2)
    /   \
5(3)    1(4)

Applying heapify procedure to index 0:
        10(0)
        /  \
     5(1)  3(2)
    /   \
 4(3)    1(4)
The heapify procedure calls itself recursively to build heap
 in top down manner.
