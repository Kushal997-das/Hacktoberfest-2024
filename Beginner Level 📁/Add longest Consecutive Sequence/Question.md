## Question: Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence

Write a function `findLongestConsecutiveSequence` that takes an unsorted array of integers and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

### Example

```python
findLongestConsecutiveSequence([100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]) # Output should be 4, for the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4]
