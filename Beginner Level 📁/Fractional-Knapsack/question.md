### Problem: **Fractional Knapsack Problem**

#### Objective:
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by placing items (or fractions of items) in a knapsack of limited capacity. Unlike the 0/1 knapsack problem where items must either be taken or left entirely, in the fractional knapsack problem, you are allowed to take any fraction of an item. 

#### Problem Statement:
You are given:
- A set of `n` items, where each item `i` has:
  - A **value** `v[i]`
  - A **weight** `w[i]`
- A knapsack with a **maximum capacity** `W`

Your task is to:
1. **Maximize** the total value in the knapsack.
2. You are allowed to take fractions of items if the whole item cannot fit in the remaining knapsack capacity.

#### Constraints:
- You can take any fraction of an item, as long as it fits in the knapsack.
- The knapsack can carry items up to its maximum capacity `W`.

#### Input:
- **`n`**: The number of items available.
- **`v[]`**: An array of values, where `v[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` item.
- **`w[]`**: An array of weights, where `w[i]` represents the weight of the `i-th` item.
- **`W`**: The total weight capacity of the knapsack.

#### Output:
- **Maximum total value**: The maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack using a combination of whole items and fractions of items.

#### Example:

Consider the following items:

| Item | Value (v[i]) | Weight (w[i]) |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | 60           | 10            |
| 2    | 100          | 20            |
| 3    | 120          | 30            |

Knapsack Capacity (`W`) = 50

1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:
   - Item 1: 60/10 = 6
   - Item 2: 100/20 = 5
   - Item 3: 120/30 = 4

2. Sort items by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order:
   Item 1, Item 2, Item 3

3. Fill the knapsack greedily:
   - Take all of Item 1: 10 weight, 60 value
   - Take all of Item 2: 20 weight, 100 value
   - Take 2/3 of Item 3: 20 weight, 80 value (20/30 * 120)

4. Calculate the total value: 60 + 100 + 80 = 240

Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained is 240.

#### Approach:
1. **Sort the items**: To achieve maximum value, sort the items based on their **value-to-weight ratio** (i.e., `value[i] / weight[i]`) in descending order.
2. **Iterate through the sorted items**:
   - Add the full item to the knapsack if it fits.
   - If the item does not fully fit, add the fraction of the item that fits, and stop once the knapsack is full.

#### Edge Cases:
- If all items are lighter than the knapsack's capacity, take them all.
- If the knapsack's capacity is `0`, the result is `0` because nothing can be added.
- If the item weights are larger than the knapsack, the best strategy is to take the fraction of the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio.

#### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the items based on the value-to-weight ratio takes `O(n log n)`, and iterating through the sorted items takes `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` additional space is used, excluding input storage.

#### Practical Applications:
- **Logistics & Transportation**: Optimizing the value of goods that can be shipped in a vehicle with weight restrictions.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocating limited resources in the most efficient way, such as distributing food, medical supplies, or other goods.
- **Financial Investments**: When investing limited funds into different assets with varying returns, the fractional knapsack can be used to maximize the return.

#### Problem Solving Strategy:
1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
2. Sort the items in descending order based on this ratio.
3. Greedily add as much of the highest ratio item as possible to the knapsack.
4. Continue adding items or fractions of items until the knapsack is full or there are no more items to add.

This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, as choosing the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio at each step ensures the optimal solution.
