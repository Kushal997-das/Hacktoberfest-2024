### THE LEAD GAME

The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient.

The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner.

The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:

Round	Player 1	Player 2
1	140	        82
2	89	        134
3	90	        110
4	112	        106
5	88	        90
The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below:

Round	Player 1	Player 2	Leader	Lead
1	140	        82	       Player 1	58
2	229	        216	       Player 1	13
3	319	        326	       Player 2	7
4	431	        432	       Player 2	1
5	519	        522	       Player 2	3
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.

The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58 at the end of round 1) during the game.

Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner. That is, there are no ties.
