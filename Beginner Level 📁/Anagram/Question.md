# Anagram Checker in Java

Write a Java program that takes two strings as input from the user and checks whether they are anagrams of each other. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters with the exact same frequencies, regardless of their order. For example, `"listen"` and `"silent"` are anagrams, but `"hello"` and `"world"` are not.

## Requirements
1. Define a function `areAnagrams(String str1, String str2)` that checks if two strings are anagrams.
2. Use the `main` method to:
   - Prompt the user to enter two strings.
   - Call `areAnagrams` to determine if the two strings are anagrams.
   - Display a message indicating whether the strings are anagrams.
3. Your program should be case-sensitive (e.g., `"Listen"` and `"silent"` should not be considered anagrams).
4. Add appropriate comments to explain each step of the code.
