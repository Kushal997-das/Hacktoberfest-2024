You are given three rods (A, B, and C) and n disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on rod A, the smallest disk on top. The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to rod C, following these rules:

You can only move one disk at a time.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
You must use rod B as an auxiliary peg to help with the transfer.
Write a recursive function that prints the steps required to move all the disks from rod A to rod C.
