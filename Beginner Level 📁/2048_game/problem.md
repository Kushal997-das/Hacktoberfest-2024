Its a 1 player game.

It consists of a 4 x 4 board. 

It initially starts with 2 tiles with numbers 2 or 4 in each of them. 

Player is allowed to make the moves LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN on which the tiles slide in the corresponding direction. 
If two adjacent cells share the same number, they merge into one along the direction in which it slides.


The new number on the merged tile is equal to the sum of the merged tiles. On every move, a random tile appears (2 with a probability of 0.75 and 4 with a probability of 0.25) on an empty location on the board.
