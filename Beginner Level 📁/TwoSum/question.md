# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example:

### Input:
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9


### Output:
[0,1]
### Explanation:
Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.


---

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only **one valid answer** exists.
