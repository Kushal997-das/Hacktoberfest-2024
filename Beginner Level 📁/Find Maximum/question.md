# Find Maximum in a List

## Problem Statement:
Write a function `find_maximum(arr)` that takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum value from the list.

### Example:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2] Output: 9

### Constraints:
- The input list contains at least one integer.
- The list can contain both positive and negative integers.

### Expected Time Complexity:
- O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
