Problem: Trapping Rain Water

You are given an array height of non-negative integers where each element represents the elevation at that point. The width of each bar is 1. Imagine it rains over this terrain, and water is trapped between the bars. Your task is to calculate how much water can be trapped after raining.


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 units of water are trapped between the bars.
