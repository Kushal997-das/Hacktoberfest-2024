Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching
Given a text T[0. . .n-1] and a pattern P[0. . .m-1], write a function search(char P[], char T[]) that prints all occurrences of P[] present in T[] using Rabin Karp algorithm. You may assume that n > m.

Examples: 
Input:  T[] = “THIS IS A TEST TEXT”, P[] = “TEST”
Output: Pattern found at index 10


Input:  T[] =  “AABAACAADAABAABA”, P[] =  “AABA”
Output: Pattern found at index 0
        Pattern found at index 9
        Pattern found at index 12
