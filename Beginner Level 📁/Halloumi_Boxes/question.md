#Halloumi Boxes

Theofanis has n boxes, and each box has a number written on it. He wants to sort the boxes in increasing order (from smallest to largest), but his machine can only reverse (flip) sections of the boxes with a length of at most k. The question asks: Can Theofanis sort the boxes using any number of such reversals?

Input Details:

You are given multiple test cases. The number of test cases is t.
For each test case:
The first line has two integers:
n — the number of boxes.
k — the maximum length of a subarray (group of boxes) that can be reversed in one operation.
The second line has n integers — these are the numbers on the boxes.

Output:
For each test case, print "YES" if it's possible to sort the boxes using any number of reversals (with length at most k), or "NO" if it's not possible.
