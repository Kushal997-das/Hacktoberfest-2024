In this problem n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
The water trapped at index 2 is 3 units, at index 3 is 1 unit, and at index 4 is 2 units, so total is 9 units.

Input: height = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 1
n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
