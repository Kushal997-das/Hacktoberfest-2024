This issue aims to add a coding problem titled **"Shortest Palindrome"** along with its solution to the repository.

### Problem Statement:
You are given a string s. You can convert s to a
palindrome
by adding characters in front of it.

Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s = "aacecaaa"`
- **Output:** `"aaacecaaa"`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s = "abcd"`
- **Output:** ` "dcbabcd" `

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- ` s consists of lowercase English letters only.`
