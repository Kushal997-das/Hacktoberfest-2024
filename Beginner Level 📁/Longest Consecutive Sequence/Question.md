Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example:
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, its length is 4.

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints are:
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
