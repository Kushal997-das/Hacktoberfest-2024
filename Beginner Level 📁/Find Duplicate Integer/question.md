This issue aims to add a coding problem titled **"Find Duplicate Integer"** along with its solution to the repository.

### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers. Each integer in `nums` is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]`
- **Output:** `2`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`
- **Output:** `4`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10000`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`

### Follow-up:
Can you solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and using O(1) extra space?
