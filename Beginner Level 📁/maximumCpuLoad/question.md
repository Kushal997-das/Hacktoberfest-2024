# Maximum CPU Load (hard)

We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a CPU load when it is running. Our goal is to find the maximum CPU load at any time if all the jobs are running on the same machine.

> examples

```JavaScript
    maximumCpuLoad([[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]) // expect 7

    maximumCpuLoad([[6,7,10], [2,4,11], [8,12,15]]); // expect 15

    maximumCpuLoad([[1,4,2], [2,4,1], [3,6,5]]); // expect 8
```
