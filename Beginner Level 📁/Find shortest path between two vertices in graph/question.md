This problem enable you to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph with the help of Dijkstra’s algorithm.

### Problem Description 

This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the two vertices in a
weighted directed graph and it is also very popular and efficient to find each
and every path from starting (source) to terminal vertices.

Example :

#### Enter any two vertex’s between which the shortest path is to be found. 

Consider vertices as V1 to V3 respectively.

Output: the shortest path between `V1` to `V3` is: 7
